# Calculator
This was a project from The Odin Project, the assignment was so build a calculator with HTML, CSS & Javascript.
Along the way I had to refactor my code a few times as new problems arose but by the end I learned the importance of planning ahead and was able to solve each problem I encountered.

The calculator is able to complete all basic operating functions individually as well as string together multiple operations at once.
